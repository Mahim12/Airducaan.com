Airducaan.com: Back in 4th year, after I was constantly bombarded with the Trivago ad of letting users compare hotel prices, I had decided to work on a project that lets users compare ecommerce prices in India. But my coding was still sub par and I stopped working after the best version back then I could create was different windows of a browser which displayed the prices. That had no business prospects. But I always knew deep in my heart that I had to get that project out of my system. So in the summer of 2020, after I was a little confident of my coding skills especially in web development and full of energy during lockdown, I decided to end my habit of procrastination and finish the project with the day dreams of becoming the no.1 platform for comparing prices in Nepal. I envisioned an app as well that I would build out from the same codebase using IONIC. Whatâ€™s the harm in daydreaming, right? I felt comfortable with PHP so I used a SimpleHtmlDomParser library and scraped prices from 4 different sites and made a fully functional website with a decent design for a first version. Hosting website felt cool!   

The things I truly did or understood after working on this projects are: 

1.Importance of a framework. Importance of business framework.

2. Why don't you need office space right away. There is a history of great companies starting out of a garage. 

3. Web scraping. 

4. Importance of a database because I was scraping without storing it which made the site too slow. 

5. How code works differently in local server vs Web server (DIgital Ocean was hosted in US so the prices came out in dollars instead of NPR) 

6. Learnt about cron jobs.
